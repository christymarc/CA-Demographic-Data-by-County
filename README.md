All data drawn from https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/CA/PST045219.

The CSV is an accumulation of the California census data sorted by county. The dataset includes demographical data on population, race, age, housing, education, health, income, etc. Data has been cleaned and rearranged for easy usage. Original "Fact" titles remain the same except for "FIPS Code" where I have taken off the state specifier (the first two numbers) and only left numbers distinguishing county.
